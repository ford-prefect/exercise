# Pelvic Tilt

This one seems trivial but is the gateway to most, if not all the exercises that follow.

## Standalone

Independently, the pelvic tilt lets you examine the engagement between your pelvis, thighs and knees at the very least.

The process of doing this exercise lets you examine and pick apart the engagement of these three.

## "Core engagement"

A good way to experience what is usually referred to as core engagement is to sit down, have your shoulders relaxed and arms out in front of you on a table, do a pelvic tilt, and then exaggerate by trying to touch the top of your diaphragm to your pelvis.

You do not actual bend your body, but are inducing a tension in your lower torso to simulate what engaging your core feels like.

_[Note: Maybe these static "exercises" deserve a separate section of their own]_

## In other exercises

In planks, push-ups, bridges, more or less everything, the pelvic tilt lets you ground the bridge of your upper and lower body.

This prevents your body from acting as a flappy noodle leaking energy in unintended ways, and work as a coherent whole.
