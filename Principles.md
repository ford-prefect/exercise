# Basic Principles

This is a set of basic tenets to keep in mind both during the exercise itself, but also in general through periods where you are exercising.

## Purpose

The point of the exercise is neither prescription nor repetition. It is to:

* **Experience** each aspect of what you're feeling through the movement and in between

* **Observe** how your body reacts to or deals with the experience 

* **Explore** changes in the movement and the mind that change what you experience and what you observe in the experience

## Be Present

At the start of a workout, take some time to *situate yourself*. This might include:

* Some period of stillness or breathing to provide some space from whatever you were doing before.

* A review of what it is you intend to do in this session. Remember that you intend and what will happen may or may not be the same.

* Following this, _erase expectation_. This is hard, but your experiences are not the same every time, and expectations are an indicator that you think your intention will always translate into the same experience, which is flawed.

## Breathe

For some reason you need to be reminded to do this.
