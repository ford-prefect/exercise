# Push Up

## Don't push

The key to a push up is to not think of it as _pushing_ yourself up with your arms, but as _pulling_ your body up. The mechanism doesn't change much, but the intent translates into what your body does in the process

## You're a plank

Think of yourself as a rigid structure, being pulled up by a handle on your lower back. If you're maintaining a pelvic tilt, this should allow your lower back to not get too involved in the process.

## It's not exactly up

A push up is not a vertical upward movement. It cannot be given that you have a fixed fulcrum, namely your feet. The actual movement is diagonal, upwards and backwards.

## Mechanics

### Rotate your elbows

This helps engage your chest in the process

### Foot position matters

Wider feet help stability and make things a bit easier.

### Hand position matters

Where your hands are with respect to your shoulders determines which part of the back of your shoulder gets involved. Higher up, you involve the trapezoids and neck. Learning the rest is a work in progress.
